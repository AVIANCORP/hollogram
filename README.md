<h1>Hollogram</h1>
<h3> A Social Media That You Control</h3>
</div>
Hollogram is a project that plans to make the Budgi concept into reality. The main issue with social media is that it stores data in places you cannot pull it down from on a whim. If you find out about a data breach or a company abusing your data, it will be months if not years after the incident happened. With Hollogram you are 100% in control of your local data and know about everything that happens to it. Not only is that an inbuilt function with Hollogram but it is only one of many functions that will be implemented into the client.

Some of the features Hollogram hopes to have added will be:
* Multi-protocol communication
* Database flexibility
* Data storage / hosting capabilities
* API hosting and management
* Multi-user / Multi-network accessibility
